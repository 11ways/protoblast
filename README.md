Extend native objects with helpful methods to speed up development,
or leave the native objects alone and use bound methods.

## Getting started

For more information and API documentation, visit the [Protoblast homepage](http://protoblast.develry.be).

## Installation

    $ npm install protoblast

## Features

* Targeted for node.js & optimal performance, but perfectly usable in the browser
* A way to use all new methods without modifying native prototypes

## Todo

* Write documentation (currently a WIP)
* Write more unit tests (coverage is currently around 60%)
* Finish browser unit tests
* ...

## Use

You can use Protoblast in 2 ways.

### Modify the native prototypes

This is the easiest way to use all the new methods & shims.
Ideal for internal or big projects.

```javascript
require('protoblast')();

// Now new native methods have been added
var arr = [5,9,3,4,1];

arr.flashsort();
// [1, 3, 4, 5, 9]
```

### Use bound functions

You can also get an object that has pre-bound all the new methods,
without modifying anything.

It's more verbose, but should be the way to use Protoblast in redistributable
modules.

```javascript
var Blast = require('protoblast')(false);

// Now new native methods have been added
var arr = [5,9,3,4,1];

Blast.Bound.Array.flashsort(arr);
// [1, 3, 4, 5, 9]
```
